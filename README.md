Easily create item insertion request for entities using a selection tool! Great for starting up builds that need some items to bootstrap.
Press the keybind [Default: `Alt + P`] once to select the tool, and a second time to open the configuration GUI.
Please report any bugs here or on [github](https://github.com/protocol-1903/item-inserter)
